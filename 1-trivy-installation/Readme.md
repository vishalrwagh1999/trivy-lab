## 📌 Install Trivy on AWS EC2 (Ubuntu)

Run the following commands one by one:

```bash
sudo apt-get install wget gnupg
```
✔ Installs **wget** (used to download files) and **gnupg** (used for key verification).

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/trivy.gpg] https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-repo/deb generic main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/trivy.list
```
✔ Adds the official **Trivy apt repository** to your system  
✔ Ensures all packages from it are verified using `trivy.gpg`

---

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```
✔ Refreshes the system package index  
✔ Allows apt to detect the newly added Trivy repository
