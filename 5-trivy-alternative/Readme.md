# Container Security Auditing Tools

This repository provides a quick start guide for using **Grype** and **Docker Scout** as alternatives to Trivy for scanning container images.

## Prerequisites
- **Homebrew** (for macOS installation)
- **Docker Desktop** (running locally)
- **Docker Hub Account** (for Scout authentication)

## 1. Grype (by Anchore)
Grype is a vulnerability scanner for container images and filesystems. It is known for its speed and ease of use in CI/CD pipelines.

### Installation
On macOS, install via Homebrew:
```
brew install grype
```
Github Link : https://github.com/anchore/grype
## Usage
To scan the python:3.10-slim image and view all detected vulnerabilities:

```
grype python:3.10-slim
```

## 2. Docker Scout
Docker Scout is a native security tool integrated directly into the Docker ecosystem. It doesn't just find vulnerabilities; it provides detailed remediation advice and recommendations for base image upgrades.

Docker scout documentation : https://docs.docker.com/scout/
### Authentication
Before using Scout, you must be logged into your Docker account:

```
docker login
```

### Usage

#### A. High-Level Summary
Get a "Quickview" of the image's security posture, including a summary of vulnerabilities and how it compares to the base image:

```
docker scout quickview python:3.10-slim
```

#### B. Detailed CVE List
To see the full list of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) found in the image:

````
docker scout cves python:3.10-slim
````

### Key Benefits: Which one to use?

Both Grype and Docker Scout are excellent alternatives to Trivy, but they serve slightly different purposes depending on your priorities:

### Use Grype if:

 - Speed is your priority: You need the fastest possible scan in a CI/CD pipeline.

 - You want Open Source: You prefer a tool that is 100% free, requires no account, and works completely offline once the database is downloaded.

 - You use SBOMs: You are already using tools like Syft and want a scanner that integrates perfectly with the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) ecosystem.

### Use Docker Scout if:
 - You need a "Fix" plan: You don't just want a list of bugs; you want Docker to tell you exactly which base image (e.g., python:3.10.15-slim) will fix them.

 - You want built-in convenience: You are already using Docker Desktop and Docker Hub and want a security dashboard that is already "just there."

 - You are a visual person: You prefer the "Quickview" summaries and the ability to see your security posture directly within the Docker Desktop app or Hub UI.
